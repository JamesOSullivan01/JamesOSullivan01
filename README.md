### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, James O'Sullivan
#### Full-Stack Web Developer
With 15 years in the military, I achieved my long-term goal of becoming a Special Forces Medical Sergeant. I am trusted for my expertise, leadership, and adherence to policies in high-stakes, austere environments.

I successfully completed the intensive web development 'bootcamp' program at Codeup. Furthermore, I hold an A.A. degree in General Studies and take great pride in my role as a co-owner of a thriving senior placement business in Houston.

Moving forward, I aspire to harness my proficiency in diverse domains such as special operations, technology development, and problem-solving to create forward-thinking solutions that elevate the overall quality of life for communities. Through the integration of cutting-edge technologies, streamlining operational workflows, and drawing upon my multifaceted background, I am dedicated to fostering positive transformation and establishing an elevated standard of well-being for individuals across the spectrum.
